```

## CHALLENGE 1



```{r movies}
library(tidyverse)
library(mosaic)

f <-"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/difiore/ADA-datasets/master/IMDB-movies.csv"
d <- read.csv(f)
e <- filter(d, startYear %in% 1920:1979 & runtimeMinutes <240) %>%
  mutate(decade = startYear - (startYear %% 10))

p <- ggplot(e, aes(runtimeMinutes)) + labs(x= "Movie Run Time") + geom_histogram() + facet_wrap( ~ decade)
p

results <- data.frame(
  "Mean" = mean(runtimeMinutes ~ decade, data = e), 
  "Standard Deviation" = sd(runtimeMinutes ~ decade, data = e)
)

n <- 100
single_sample <- data.frame(
  decade = c(1920,1930,1940,1950,1960,1970),
  mean = mean(runtimeMinutes ~ decade, data = sample_n(e, size = n, replace = FALSE)),
  standard_deviation = sd(runtimeMinutes ~ decade, data = sample_n(e, size = n, replace = FALSE))
)

se_mean <- favstats(mean ~ decade, data = single_sample)
se_mean
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
