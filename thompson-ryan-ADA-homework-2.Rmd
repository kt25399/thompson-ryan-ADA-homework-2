```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## CHALLENGE 1



```{r movies}
library(tidyverse)

f <-"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/difiore/ADA-datasets/master/IMDB-movies.csv"
d <- read.csv(f)
e <- filter(d, startYear >= 1920 & startYear <= 1979 & runtimeMinutes <240) 
e <- mutate(e, decade = startYear - (startYear %% 10))

p <- ggplot(e, aes(runtimeMinutes)) + labs(x= "Movie Run Time") + geom_histogram() + facet_wrap( ~ decade)
p
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
